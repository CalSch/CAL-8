HEX : NAME ARGS             - DESCRIPTION
0x0 : NULL                  - does nothing
0x1 : LDA  addr             - Loads a value into the accumulator
0x2 : STA  addr             - Stores a value from the accumulator
0x3 : ADD  addr             - Adds to the accumulator
0x4 : SUB  addr             - Subtracts from the accumulator
0x5 : JUMP addr             - Jump somewhere
0x6 : JSUB addr             - Jump to subroutine
0x7 : RET                   - Return from subroutine
0x8 : COMP (a)addr, (b)addr - Compares 2 values
0x9 : BIE  addr             - Branch based on the last comparison (a==b)
0xA : BNE  addr             - Branch based on the last comparison (a!=b)
0xB : BIG  addr             - Branch based on the last comparison (a>b)
0xC : BIL  addr             - Branch based on the last comparison (a<b)
0xD : NULL
0xE : NULL
0xF : NULL

NOTE: if arg2 is 0xF then arg1 will be treated as a literal value (except for with COMP)
